2. The subjective questions can be answered by
-Typing the answer in english
-Typing it in the user's native language or
-Taking a voice input in any language, converting it to text and then converting this text to english text using the google translate api.
3. Analysing this data using an ML model and depicting it visually on the dashboard.
